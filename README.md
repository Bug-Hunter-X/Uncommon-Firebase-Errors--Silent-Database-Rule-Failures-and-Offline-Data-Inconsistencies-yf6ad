# Uncommon Firebase Errors: Silent Database Rule Failures and Offline Data Inconsistencies
This repository demonstrates two subtle error scenarios in Firebase:
1. **Silent Database Rule Failure:**  A write operation fails due to restrictive database rules but does not throw a readily identifiable error in the client-side code.
2. **Offline Data Inconsistency:** Issues handling data synchronization during network interruptions and subsequent reconnections.
The `bug.js` file showcases these issues. `bugSolution.js` provides improved error handling and data management strategies.  This includes more robust error checking and explicit handling of offline situations and the use of transactions to ensure data integrity.
